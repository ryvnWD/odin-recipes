    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>½ cup soy sauce</li>
        <li>¼ cup kalamansi juice</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, smashed</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons white sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon fish sauce (Optional)</li>
        <li>ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 pound beef steak, sliced 1/4-inch thick</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil, divided, or as needed</li>
        <li>1 large onion, cut into rings</li>
        <li>⅛ cup water (Optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine soy sauce, kalamansi juice, garlic, sugar, fish sauce, and pepper in a bowl. Taste and adjust to your liking. Add sliced beef, making sure it is coated evenly. Marinate for at least 30 minutes or up to 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a wok or pan over medium-high heat. Fry potatoes in the hot oil until the edges turn golden brown, 7 to 10 minutes. Transfer to a plate.</li>
        <li>Heat remaining oil in the same pan over medium-high heat and fry onions until edges turn brown, 7 to 10 minutes. Transfer to the same plate.</li>
        <li>Heat the same pan over medium-high heat. Reserve marinade and fry beef in batches, adding more vegetable oil if necessary, until browned and no longer pink in the centers, 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer to the plate and continue with remaining beef.</li>
        <li>Pour reserved marinade into the pan with water to deglaze, scraping up browned bits from the bottom of the pan using a wooden spoon. Taste and adjust seasonings. Return beef back to the pan with some onion, leaving remaining onion for garnish; reduce heat and let simmer until sauce has thickened, 7 to 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Slide beef and sauce onto a serving plate. Garnish with remaining onion. Place potatoes on the side and serve.</li>
    </ol>
